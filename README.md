If you are a fan of Pokemons then you already know what Pokedex is? :-)

If you are not then here is a quick intro for you - Pokedex is a device which shows information about various Pokemons (Creatures with special abilities)

This app is created in React using create-react-app which mimics the functionality of a pokedex. 

You can easily start the app by cloning the repo, installing all the dependies and using the following command in the terminal
npm start

This project is a work under progress, I plan on adding more interesting features and making a game out of it soon.

I hope you like it.
